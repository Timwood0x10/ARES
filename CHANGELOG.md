## [0.2.2] - 2026-06-18

### New Features

- **Embedding Lifecycle Unification**: Unified embedding lifecycle across distillation, storage, and retrieval pipelines. Embedding workflows now share a common lifecycle model, reducing code duplication and ensuring consistent behavior during creation, update, and deletion of embeddings.
- **Context Cleaning**: Automatic context window management with tool call causality preservation. The context cleaner maintains causal ordering of tool calls during cleanup, preventing out-of-order execution after context truncation.
- **Workflow Enhancements**: `MutableDAG.ReplaceNode` for replacing nodes at runtime. Custom `RecoveryHandler` for failure recovery per workflow step. Enhanced event propagation across workflow execution.
- **Portfolio Simulator**: Investment portfolio simulation system with multi-asset backtesting. Includes research memory bridge connecting portfolio simulation results to the research memory system for data-driven investment decisions.
- **Investment Simulator**: Standalone investment simulation module for modeling and analyzing investment strategies.
- **CoinGecko Crypto Feed**: Real-time cryptocurrency price data integration via CoinGecko API, enabling live market data for trading analysis.
- **Public Marketmaking API**: Marketmaking API migrated from internal to public (`api/marketmaking/`), with multi-asset backtesting support. Includes comprehensive paper trading, chaos testing, and backtesting capabilities.
- **Quant Trading Example**: Complete quantitative trading example with SQLite backend, demonstrating end-to-end quant trading workflow.
- **Tool Lifecycle Events**: Emit lifecycle events for tool execution, enabling observability and monitoring of tool calls throughout their lifecycle.
- **Memory Metadata Propagation**: Expanded metadata propagation across memory operations, enriching context with session and agent metadata.

### Refactors

- Enhanced configuration safety with improved validation and error handling in the API layer (`api/config.go`, `api/service.go`).
- Renamed `quant-demo` to `quant-trading` with updated configuration and documentation.
- Enforced snapshot-only data constraint in analyst prompts to ensure data consistency.

### Bug Fixes

- Resolved data race and timing issues in `DynamicExecutor` recovery path.
- Fixed documentation file naming inconsistencies.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-16

### New Features

- **MCP Client**: Model Context Protocol client implementation with JSON-RPC 2.0 messaging, stdio and SSE transport support, tool schema management, and connection lifecycle management.
- **Web Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring dashboard with WebSocket hub, REST API v2, orchestrator for multi-agent coordination, event bridge for system state streaming, and static asset serving.
- **Flight Recorder**: Multi-agent runtime intelligence recording with timeline tracking, decision logging, diagnostics engine, agent genealogy graph, DOT/JSON export, and replay pipeline.
- **Chaos Engineering Arena**: Fault injection framework with injector supporting process_kill, network_partition, latency_spike, and kill_orchestrator fault types; resilience scoring with configurable metrics; survival mode for continuous chaos testing; HTTP API and YAML scenario configuration.
- **Callbacks System**: Event-driven callback mechanism with typed event contexts, handler registry, and lifecycle hooks for agent/tool/runtime events.
- **LLM Output Parsing**: Multi-provider output adapters (OpenAI, Ollama, OpenRouter), prompt template engine with Go template syntax, function calling extraction and validation, schema-based parameter validation, and streaming output parser.
- **Function Calling**: LLM function calling support with tool schema generation, argument extraction, and result formatting.
- **Agent Genealogy**: Agent lineage tracking with parent-child relationships, birth/death event recording, and genealogy graph export.
- **Event Auto-Compaction**: Configurable event store compaction with retention policies, snapshot-based trimming, and automatic execution.
- **Tool Lifecycle Hooks**: Pre/post execution hooks for tools with context injection and error handling.
- **Quant Demo**: Quantitative analysis example with CSV data processing.
- **DevAgent Example**: Development agent example with workflow configuration.
- **MCP Dashboard Example**: Dashboard integration example with MCP transport.
- **Capability Demo**: Tool capability demonstration example.

## v0.2.0 (2026-06-11)

### New Features

- **Leader Failover**: Checkpoint-based recovery with `LeaderSupervisor` detecting leader failure, recovering stale tasks from last checkpoint, and reassigning work to available sub-agents. `ColdRestartStrategy` for deterministic recovery.
- **Runtime Dynamic Graph**: `MutableDAG` with thread-safe mutation (add/remove nodes and edges at runtime). `DynamicExecutor` with `ApplyMode` for hot-reload without stopping execution. Incremental cycle detection on edge insertion.
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: `InterruptConfig` on workflow steps for human approval gates. `InterruptHandler` blocks execution until approved. `InterruptStore` provides crash recovery of pending approvals.
- **Agent Resurrection Plugin**: Pluggable `HealthChecker` interface for custom health detection. `HeartbeatAdapter` for heartbeat-based liveness. `Supervisor` for automatic agent restart on failure.
- **Event Sourcing**: `EventStore` interface with optimistic concurrency control. `MemoryEventStore` for dev/test, `PostgresEventStore` for production. 17 event types covering agent lifecycle, tasks, sessions, workflows, and failover. Pub/sub via `Subscribe` with filtered event channels. DLQ auto-retry with configurable retry budgets.
- **Pluggable Vector Store**: `VectorStore` interface replacing concrete `*VectorSearcher` in Repository. PostgreSQL + pgvector for production, in-memory for dev/test. Drop-in replacement support for Qdrant, Milvus, SQLite, or custom backends.
- **WorkflowService API**: High-level workflow orchestration abstraction over the DAG engine.
